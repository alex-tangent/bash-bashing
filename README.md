# Bash Bashing ⌨️👊

Hey there! Welcome to Bash Bashing, a fun little side project where I'm collecting some cool shell scripts, mostly Bash but also some Fish shell scripts. You know, because sometimes you just want a quick fix without installing a gazillion apps. 🤷

I've collected a bunch of random script ideas through the years that never got beyon the brainstorming phase and with LLMs in the mix some might actually get passt the first commit, so who knows? Maybe we'll throw in some fancy stuff later. But for now, let's just enjoy making life easier, one script at a time. 😁

## Repo Structure 🗂️

- `scripts/`: The star of the show! All the shell scripts are here.
  - `system/`: System management, package management, and the like. ⚙️
  - `networking/`: Network stuff, because who doesn't love a good ping? 🏓
  - `files/`: File management and manipulation. 📁
  - `fish/`: Fish scripts for a buffed fish. 💪🐟
  - `automation/`: Automating things, 'cause we're all about that life. 🤖
  - `ai/`: Maybe we'll play with some AI and LLM magic later. 🧙‍♂️
  - `utils/`: Random utility scripts. 🛠️
  - `misc/`: Everything else that doesn't fit anywhere else. 🎒
- `docs/`: Guides, tutorials, and other helpful stuff. 📚
- `devcontiners/`: Devcontainers for an effective dev setup. 🐋

## Future Plans (Maybe? 🤔)

- Playing with Yeoman and Fig, because automation is cool! 😎
- Checking out Github Blocks for some bespoke documentation with native code integration. 🔧
- Collaborating with LLMs, because why not? 🧠
- Adding some AI-driven tools to spice things up. 🌶️
- Exploring AI in script development, because efficiency is life. ⚡
